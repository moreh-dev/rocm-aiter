"""Hand-written HIP decode-phase FP8 paged MQA indexer logits kernel for gfx950.

The paged half of the DeepSeek-V3.2 / GLM-5 sparse-attention lightning indexer:

    logits[m, n] = sum_h relu(Q[m,h,:] . K[n,:]) * w[m,h] * kv_scale[n]

K and its per-token dequant scale are co-packed in a paged cache and gathered
through a block table. Drop-in for ``deepgemm_fp8_paged_mqa_logits``, so the two
can be A/B'd on identical inputs.

Fixed at n_heads=32, head_dim=128 -- the shipped GLM-5-FP8 indexer shape.
``is_supported()`` gates on that, so a caller that also has to serve other shapes
can route them to the Triton kernel rather than trip a TORCH_CHECK.
