"""Hand-written HIP prefill-phase FP8 MQA indexer logits kernel for gfx950.

The dense half of the DeepSeek-V3.2 / GLM-5 sparse-attention lightning indexer:

    logits[m, n] = sum_h relu(Q[m,h,:] . K[n,:]) * w[m,h] * kv_scale[n]

K has already been gathered into a contiguous ``[N, 128]`` buffer, so there is no
block table. Drop-in for ``aiter.ops.triton.attention.fp8_mqa_logits``, so the two
can be A/B'd on identical inputs.

Fixed at n_heads=32, head_dim=128 -- the shipped GLM-5-FP8 indexer shape.
``is_supported()`` gates on that, so a caller that also has to serve other shapes
can route them to the Triton kernel rather than trip a TORCH_CHECK.
